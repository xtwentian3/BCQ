# Batch-Constrained Deep Q-Learning (BCQ)

Batch-Constrained deep Q-learning (BCQ) is the first batch deep reinforcement learning, an algorithm which aims to learn offline without interactions with the environment.

BCQ was first introduced in our [ICML 2019 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02900) which focused on continuous action domains. A discrete-action version of BCQ was introduced in a followup [Deep RL workshop NeurIPS 2019 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01708). Code for each of these algorithms can be found under their corresponding folder.
